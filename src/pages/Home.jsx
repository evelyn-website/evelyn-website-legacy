        <p>
          I'm a web-dev hobbyist who is focused on coming up with ways for
          technology to bring you closer to the people you already care about. I
          work in tech, but not as a software engineer. I love learning new
          technologies. My previous projects have been built with React, React
          Native, and Go.

                    I'm working on an iOS app that allows you to create
                    temporary group chats for events or parties. After the
                    relevant event is over, the chat is deleted. The frontend is
                    React Native and the backend is Go. It supports end-to-end
                    encryption and images. It's a work in progress, but I always
                    say I'm like three or four hard steps away from it being
                    ready.

                    many people who are tired of using Instagram or Bluesky to
                    share their photos. This project will be an invite-only
                    platform for sharing photos.

                    This project is a small literary project for my friends and
                    loved ones to share poetry, short fiction, reviews, photos,
                    and whatever else they want to share. It's a collaboration
                    with my friend Joyce, who came up with the idea. It's a
                    Jekyll static site hosted on a raspberry pi in my apartment.
                    This project was essentially spun out of an earlier effort
                    to build a lightweight tutorial for self-hosting static
                    sites called "Re-wild."

                    The basic concept is that a group admin picks a theme,
                    everybody submits a song, and then the group votes on which
                    songs they like best. It's not the most original idea, but I
                    wanted to make sure that the app feels nice to use.
