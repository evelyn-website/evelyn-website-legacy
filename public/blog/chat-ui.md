I'm working on two different apps with chat UIs. One is Bundle, which is my big project that I've been working on for about a year. The other is Give Me the Aux, which I basically threw together quickly (read: vibe coded). Give Me the Aux isn't really about chat. It's a game about music, but it has to have chat. For this, I was basically comfortable with the idea of just going as simple as possible. Long polling, no websockets, no push notifications, no encryption, no images. I just wanted it to work. Even still, there's just a crazy amount of stuff you need to get right. I still don't really feel like I've mastered it. I'm sure I'll be back here in a few months to write about it again.

Even for a simple chat UI without all those features I mentioned, there's so much you have to think about.
